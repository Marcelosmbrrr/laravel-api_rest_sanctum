# Project Guide
This application is a Rest API created with the Laravel 9 and package Sanctum for authentication. Being sort, each request to a CRUD operation, of the UserController or CustomerController, for example, needs a bearer token that is generated in a successfully login, and stored in "personal_access_token" table.
